These instructions are for Windows machines. If I start doing more development on Linux I'll update instructions for that platform as well.


Install Python 3: https://www.python.org/downloads/
Install Pip if not already installed with Python.
Install SCons using Pip "pip install scons"
Install gcc by doing this guide: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-mingw
Install Cppcheck: https://cppcheck.sourceforge.io/
Add Cppcheck directory to PATH:
    directory: C:\Program Files\Cppcheck
    Modifying Path:
        1. Windows key + "edit the system environment variables"
        2. Select "Environment Variables"
        3. Select Path then click New
        4. Copy the directory and save it.
Restart terminal if you had it open.
In the top-level firmware/ directory run scons --project=helloWorld

For arm projects install the gcc arm compiler: https://packages.msys2.org/package/mingw-w64-x86_64-arm-none-eabi-gcc?repo=mingw64
Install ST link driver: https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stsw-link009.html
For STM32 programming: https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeprog.html

Eventually I might setup a container or automated install script for this.

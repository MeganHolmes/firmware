This project is the first time I have used gdb so most of these instructions are for gdb.

In one terminal start the gdb server by using "st-util"
In another terminal use the command "arm-none-eabi-gdb build\blinky.elf"
type "target extended-remote :4242"
type "load"
Use "continue" to let the chip run
Use ctrl+c to stop the chip

Use "info register" to see the register information.
use "info locals" to see local variables
Use "p /x *[NAME]" where [NAME] is a macro in src\processorSpecific\ST\STM32F10\manufacturer\stm32f10x.h
Use "bt" to get a backtrace.
To set breakpoints, type "break [filename]:[linenumber]"
To step "s"

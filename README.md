# Megan Holmes Firmware

This repo is a collection of all firmware related code I have written or used. The idea is to maximize how much code I can reuse across projects and controllers. I am using FreeRTOS for my RTOS, SCons as my build system, and Cppcheck for my linter. The linter is automatically called during the SCons build.

Controllers in use: STM32F013RB

## Individual projects:
### Balancer
This project is intended to be the inverted pendulum problem. It is a robot with 2 wheels in parallel trying to balance itself. The plan is to add wireless capability so it can be controlled via a drone controller.

Controller Used: STM32F013RB

Project Specific Files: ```src/projectSpecific/balancer/```

Build command: ```scons --project=balancer```
### Blinky
Flashes an LED every 1s. This exists for when I was setting up SCons to compile for ARM as well as when prototyping autogenerated pin configs. If you are trying to setup the build system for a new controller, use this project.

Controller Used: STM32F013RB

Project Specific Files: ```src/projectSpecific/blinky/```

Build command: ```scons --project=blinky```
### Hello World
Prints hello world on the console on Windows. This exists for when I was setting up SCons and Cppcheck. If you are trying to setup this repo and build system on a new device, just use this project until SCons and the Cppcheck work.

Controller Used: x86 Computers

Project Specific Files: ```src/projectSpecific/helloWorld/```

Build command: ```scons --project=helloWorld```
